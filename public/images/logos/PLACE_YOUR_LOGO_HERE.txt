üìù LOGO PLACEMENT INSTRUCTIONS

To replace the default "C" text logo with your custom logo:

1. Place your logo image in this folder with the name: logo-main.webp (recommended)
   - Recommended size: 200x60px or similar aspect ratio
   - Supported formats: WebP (best for web), PNG, JPG, SVG
   - WebP provides best compression and quality for web optimization

2. Format priority (website checks in this order):
   - logo-main.webp (BEST - 25-50% smaller files, excellent quality)
   - logo-main.svg (vector version - perfect scalability)
   - logo-main.png (good quality, supports transparency)
   - logo-main.jpg (smaller file size, no transparency)

3. Optional additional logo files you can add:
   - logo-small.webp (48x48px for mobile/favicon)
   - logo-white.webp (white version for dark backgrounds)
   - logo-horizontal.webp (horizontal layout version)

3. The website will automatically detect and use your logo image.
   If no logo-main.png is found, it falls back to the text "C" logo.

4. After adding your logo, refresh the website to see the changes.

Example naming:
‚úÖ logo-main.webp (BEST choice)
‚úÖ logo-main.svg
‚úÖ logo-main.png
‚úÖ logo-main.jpg
‚ùå my-logo.webp (wrong name)
‚ùå logo.webp (wrong name)

üöÄ WebP Benefits:
- 25-50% smaller file sizes than PNG/JPG
- Faster page loading
- Better SEO performance
- Supports transparency like PNG
- Modern browser support (95%+ coverage)

For best results, ensure your logo:
- Has good contrast against white backgrounds
- Is readable at small sizes (mobile navigation)
- Maintains quality when scaled
- Has transparent background if it's not rectangular
